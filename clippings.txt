la croissance de la quantité d’énergie consommée par personne, qui permet en termes purement physiques d’augmenter la productivité des gens qui travaillent, a pour conséquence d’assurer la nourriture, le logement, l’habillement, les loisirs, etc., des gens qui ne travaillent pas (au sens d’une production directe), dont les retraités et les étudiants.

Conserver, dans un monde énergétiquement contraint, une grande autonomie à l’âge de la retraite, et plus encore à l’âge de la dépendance, revient à ce que les retraités gardent pour eux une fraction croissante de la production physique brute du pays, au détriment de ceux qui travaillent.

Dans ce monde d’énergie quasi gratuite, l’emploi baisse naturellement toutes choses égales par ailleurs : dès qu’il existe une usine regroupant quelques centaines ou milliers d’ouvriers faisant la même chose, les remplacer par une machine permet de substituer beaucoup de travail (qui coûte cher) par un peu de travail (pour concevoir la machine et la fabriquer) et beaucoup d’énergie (quasi gratuite). Le formidable différentiel de prix entre énergie humaine et énergie fossile va donc engendrer la mécanisation, la robotisation, et tout ce qui s’ensuit.

Jusqu’à une époque somme toute assez récente, on ne s’encombrait pas de nourrir ces bouches-là : le sort commun du délinquant était la mort (pendaison, décapitation, bûcher…) dans des délais assez rapides. Cette cruauté vue de notre bout de la lorgnette était en fait une réponse logique dans un univers à la productivité limitée : déposséder un peu les « honnêtes gens » pour nourrir et loger ceux qui avaient fauté aurait demandé une bonté d’âme trop difficile à trouver. Du coup, pour l’essentiel des civilisations préindustrielles, seuls subsistaient les prisonniers qui continuaient à participer à la production : esclaves (qui produisaient du travail), galériens (qui produisaient du mouvement), travailleurs forcés, etc. Il est évident que, en univers énergétiquement contraint, ces mauvais souvenirs risquent de redevenir d’actualité.

À l’échelle de quelques siècles, la « lecture énergétique » du monde rend donc logiques la fin de l’esclavage, la désertification des campagnes européennes et américaines, la mondialisation, l’étalement urbain et le pavillon pour tous, les mégapoles cosmopolites, la grande distribution, l’apparition puis la hausse de la durée des congés payés, l’informatique pour tous, les voyages des retraités à travers le monde, la baisse du temps de travail et les forfaits pour portable à 20 euros par mois. Les gains de productivité et la diffusion des techniques ne sont pas la cause, mais bien la conséquence d’une augmentation de la consommation d’énergie permise par son exploitation à rendement croissant.

le coût de l’énergie est de 3 % de notre PIB, alors ce n’est pas grave si ce coût augmente de 30 %, dira l’économiste : il suffit d’avoir un point de croissance supplémentaire pour résoudre le problème ! Mais, si cette hausse est synonyme d’une baisse de la quantité disponible (car à ce moment l’offre baisse et donc les prix montent, suivant une vieille règle de marché), alors tous les flux physiques pilotés par l’énergie vont baisser d’autant, et notre cher PIB ne pourra pas croître alors qu’il « aurait dû ».

Une première manière d’aller vers cette analyse de la dépendance (qui est aussi une manière de raisonner sur la responsabilité élargie) est d’imputer aux grands secteurs de l’inventaire les émissions du secteur électrique, au prorata de l’électricité consommée par chaque secteur, ce qui fait du coup disparaître la production électrique comme secteur individualisé.

Et ce n’est pas le transport depuis la Chine qui explique ce résultat, mais bien le fait que de l’électricité au charbon ait été utilisée pour la fabrication du panneau. En pareil cas, il n’y a pas de CO2 évité, mais du CO2 rajouté. En subventionnant le photovoltaïque, la puissance publique subventionne alors… une hausse des émissions (faible il est vrai, puisque tout cela porte sur des productions marginales).

    Au milieu des ténèbres de l'avenir on peut déjà découvrir trois vérités très claires. La première est que tous les hommes de nos jours sont entraînés par une force inconnue qu'on peut espérer régler et ralentir, mais non vaincre, qui tantôt les pousse doucement et -tantôt les précipite vers la destruction de l'aristocratie ; la seconde, que, parmi toutes les sociétés du monde, celles qui auront toujours le plus de peine à échapper pendant longtemps au gouvernement absolu seront précisément ces sociétés où l'aristocratie n'est plus et ne peut plus être ; la troisième enfin, que nulle part le despotisme ne doit produire des effets plus pernicieux que dans ces sociétés-là ; car plus qu'aucune autre sorte de gouvernement il y favorise le développement de tous les vices auxquels ces sociétés sont spécialement sujettes, et les pousse ainsi du côté même où, suivant une inclinaison naturelle, elles penchaient déjà.

Yet research finds that regardless of whether people identify themselves as liberals or conservatives, what they think about any one issue, like, say, abortion, has relatively little relation to what they believe about other issues, such as the death penalty or illegal immigration. In other words, we have the impression that our particular beliefs are all derived from some overarching philosophy, but the reality is that we arrive at them quite independently, and often haphazardly.

the “theory of relative deprivation” states that people feel distressed by circumstances only inasmuch as their hardship exceeds that of the people around them. Thus if your house burns down in a freak fire, you’re devastated, but if your whole city is wiped out in an earthquake and hundreds of your neighbors die, you feel lucky to be alive.

TO RECAP, Motivation 2.0 suffers from three compatibility problems. It doesn’t mesh with the way many new business models are organizing what we do—because we’re intrinsically motivated purpose maximizers, not only extrinsically motivated profit maximizers. It doesn’t comport with the way that twenty-first-century economics thinks about what we do—because economists are finally realizing that we’re full-fledged human beings, not single-minded economic robots. And perhaps most important, it’s hard to reconcile with much of what we actually do at work—because for growing numbers of people, work is often creative, interesting, and self-directed rather than unrelentingly routine, boring, and other-directed.

In other words, rewards can perform a weird sort of behavioral alchemy: They can transform an interesting task into a drudge. They can turn play into work.

Deci and two colleagues reanalyzed nearly three decades of studies on the subject to confirm the findings. “Careful consideration of reward effects reported in 128 experiments lead to the conclusion that tangible rewards tend to have a substantially negative effect on intrinsic motivation,” they determined. “When institutions—families, schools, businesses, and athletic teams, for example—focus on the short-term and opt for controlling people’s behavior,” they do considerable long-term damage.3

As Suvorov explains, “Rewards are addictive in that once offered, a contingent reward makes an agent expect it whenever a similar task is faced, which in turn compels the principal to use rewards over and over again.” And before long, the existing reward may no longer suffice. It will quickly feel less like a bonus and more like the status quo—which then forces the principal to offer larger rewards to achieve the same effect.20

What’s more, for some people, much of what they do all day consists of these routine, not terribly captivating, tasks. In these situations, it’s best to try to unleash the positive side of the Sawyer Effect by attempting to turn work into play—to increase the task’s variety, to make it more like a game, or to use it to help master other skills. Alas, that’s not always possible. And this means that sometimes, even “if-then” rewards are an option.

Explain why this poster is so important and why sending it out now is critical to your organization’s mission. • Acknowledge that the task is boring.This is an act of empathy, of course. And the acknowledgment will help people understand why this is the rare instance when “if-then” rewards are part of how your organization operates. • Allow people to complete the task their own way.

It requires conceptual, breakthrough, artistic thinking. And as we’ve learned, “if-then” rewards are an ideal way to squash this sort of thinking. Your best approach is to have already established the conditions of a genuinely motivating environment. The baseline rewards must be sufficient. That is, the team’s basic compensation must be adequate and fair—particularly compared with people doing similar work for similar organizations. Your nonprofit must be a congenial place to work. And the people on your team must have autonomy, they must have ample opportunity to pursue mastery, and their daily duties must relate to a larger purpose. If these elements are in place, the best strategy is to provide a sense of urgency and significance—and then get out of the talent’s way.

take management’s embrace of “flex time.” Ressler and Thompson call it a “con game,” and they’re right. Flexibility simply widens the fences and occasionally opens the gates. It, too, is little more than control in sheep’s clothing. The words themselves reflect presumptions that run against both the texture of the times and the nature of the human condition.

Amy Wrzesniewski and Jane Dutton, two business school professors, have studied this phenomenon among hospital cleaners, nurses, and hairdressers. They found, for instance, that some members of the cleaning staff at hospitals, instead of doing the minimum the job required, took on new tasks—from chatting with patients to helping make nurses’ jobs go more smoothly. Adding these more absorbing challenges increased these cleaners’ satisfaction and boosted their own views of their skills. By reframing aspects of their duties, they helped make work more playful and more fully their own. “Even in low-autonomy jobs,” Wrzesniewski and Dutton write, “employees can create new domains for mastery.”

For instance, consider goals. Dweck says they come in two varieties—performance goals and learning goals. Getting an A in French class is a performance goal. Being able to speak French is a learning goal. “Both goals are entirely normal and pretty much universal,” Dweck says, “and both can fuel achievement.”8 But only one leads to mastery.

Type X behavior often holds an entity theory of intelligence, prefers performance goals to learning goals, and disdains effort as a sign of weakness. Type I behavior has an incremental theory of intelligence, prizes learning goals over performance goals, and welcomes effort as a way to improve at something that matters. Begin with one mindset, and mastery is impossible. Begin with the other, and it can be inevitable.

As he puts it, “Many characteristics once believed to reflect innate talent are actually the results of intense practice for a minimum of 10 years.”11 Mastery—of sports, music, business—requires effort (difficult, painful, excruciating, all-consuming effort) over a long time (not a week or a month, but a decade).12

one of Csikszentmihalyi’s more surprising findings is that people are much more likely to reach that flow state at work than in leisure. Work can often have the structure of other autotelic experiences: clear goals, immediate feedback, challenges well matched to our abilities. And when it does, we don’t just enjoy it more, we do it better. That’s why it’s so odd that organizations tolerate work environments that deprive large numbers of people of these experiences.

According to Lara Aknin and Elizabeth Dunn, sociologists at the University of British Columbia, and Michael Norton, a psychologist at the Harvard Business School, how people spend their money may be at least as important as how much money they earn. In particular, spending money on other people (buying flowers for your spouse rather than an MP3 player for yourself ) or on a cause (donating to a religious institution rather than going for an expensive haircut) can actually increase our subjective well-being.11

The people who’d had purpose goals and felt they were attaining them reported higher levels of satisfaction and subjective well-being than when they were in college, and quite low levels of anxiety and depression.

But the results for people with profit goals were more complicated. Those who said they were attaining their goals—accumulating wealth, winning acclaim—reported levels of satisfaction, self-esteem, and positive affect no higher than when they were students. In other words, they’d reached their goals, but it didn’t make them any happier. What’s more, graduates with profit goals showed increases in anxiety, depression, and other negative indicators—again, even though they were attaining their goals. “One cannot lead a life that is truly excellent without feeling that one belongs to something greater and more permanent than oneself.”   MIHALY CSIKSZENTMIHALYI

Gillenormand ne l’avait jamais aimé, et que ce bonhomme bref, dur et riant, qui jurait, criait, tempêtait et levait la canne, n’avait pour lui tout au plus que cette affection à la fois légère et sévère des Gérontes de comédie. Marius se trompait. Il y a des pères qui n’aiment pas leurs enfants ; il n’existe point d’aïeul qui n’adore son petit-fils. Au fond, nous l’avons dit, M. Gillenormand idolâtrait Marius.

phone had to do with the time a piece of material spends inside a plant. If you consider the total time from the moment the material comes into the plant to the minute it goes out the door as part of a finished product, you can divide that time into four elements. One of them is setup, the time the part spends waiting for a resource, while the resource is preparing itself to work on the part. Another is process time, which is the amount of time the part spends being modified into a new, more valuable form. A third element is queue time, which is the time the part spends in line for a resource while the resource is busy working on something else ahead of it. The fourth element is wait time, which is the time the part waits, not for a resource, but for another part so they can be assembled together.

That’s because a really terrific thing has happened. Before we reduced batch sizes, it wasn’t uncommon for a work center to be forced idle because it didn’t have anything to process—even though we were wading through excess inventory. It was usually because the idle work center had to wait for the one preceding it to finish a large batch of some item. Unless told otherwise by an expeditor, the materials handlers would wait until an entire batch was completed before moving it. In fact, that’s still the case. But now that the batches are smaller, the parts are ready to be moved to the next work station sooner than they were before.

"Moreover," Charlie notices, "it encourages the project leader to continue being unfocused." "How come?" "Because according to our measurement," he explains, "progress on one path compensates for a delay on another. So we encourage progressing fast on one path even though another path is delayed." "What's bad about that?" Mark asks. "If I have difficulties in one path, why shouldn't I move on the other paths where I can?" "At the end they all merge together," Charlie reminds him. "All the advance that you gain in the open paths will have to wait for the delayed path anyway.

"Tie the first soldier with a rope to the slowest soldier, to the bottleneck. That's all. What's the point in tying all the soldiers to each other? It will only force inventory between them rather than allowing the inventory to flow toward the bottleneck and accumulate there. Of course, the length of the rope, we call it the buffer, will dictate how much inventory in total you allow."

"If we tie the first soldier to the bottleneck, then the first row will be forced to walk at the rate of the bottleneck. That's good, spreading of the troop is prevented. All the other soldiers, being faster than the bottleneck, will jam pack, some behind the first row, the others behind the bottleneck. So the troop will spread over a distance that will be almost equal to the length of the rope we choose. That's neat. It will also guarantee that there is a gap before the bottleneck, so if one of the upstream soldiers stops, the bottleneck can still proceed. The inventory, the safety, accumulates there. Very nice, Johnny."

"Resource contention means that the same resource is supposed to do two different steps at the same time," he wastes our time defining a term that is clear to us. "Removing resource contention between two steps," he continues methodically, "necessitates, many times, postponing one of those steps. The problem is that, as we discussed at length, there is no clear way to decide which step to postpone. It is almost an arbitrary decision."

la Révolution était cornmencée, Mirabeau écrivait secrètement au roi : « Comparez le nouvel état des choses avec l'ancien régime ; c'est là que naissent les consolations et les espérances. Une partie des actes de l'assemblée nationale, et c'est la plus considérable, est évidemment favorable au gouvernement monarchique. N'est-ce donc rien que d'être sans parlement, sans pays d'états, sans corps de clergé, de privilégiés, de noblesse ? L'idée de ne former qu'une seule classe de citoyens aurait plu à Richelieu : cette surface égale facilite l'exercice du pouvoir. Plusieurs règnes d'un gouvernement absolu n'auraient pas fait autant que cette seule année de Révolution pour l'autorité royale. »

Comme en France, cette infériorité blessait d'autant plus que chaque jour cette classe devenait plus éclairée et plus influente, et que les fonctionnaires bourgeois de l'État, s'ils n'occupaient pas les postes les plus brillants, remplissaient déjà ceux où il y avait le plus de choses et les choses les plus utiles à faire. L'irritation contre les privilèges de la noblesse, qui, chez nous, allait tant contribuer à la Révolution, préparait en Allemagne l'approbation avec laquelle celle-ci fut d'abord reçue. Le principal rédacteur du code était pourtant un bourgeois, mais il suivait sans doute les ordres de son maître.

    Quand la noblesse possède non seulement des privilèges, mais des pouvoirs, quand elle gouverne et administre, ses droits particuliers peuvent être tout à la fois plus grands et moins aperçus. Dans les temps féodaux, on considérait la noblesse à peu près du même œil dont on considère aujourd'hui le gouvernement : on supportait les charges qu'elle imposait en vue des garanties qu'elle donnait. Les nobles avaient des privilèges gênants, ils possédaient des droits onéreux ; mais ils assuraient l'ordre publie, distribuaient la justice, faisaient exécuter la loi, venaient au secours du faible, menaient les affaires communes. A mesure que la noblesse cesse de faire ces choses, le poids de ses privilèges parait plus lourd, et leur existence même finit par ne plus se comprendre.

    De même que l'administration centrale n'a, à vrai dire, qu'un seul agent à Paris, elle n'a qu'un seul agent dans chaque province.

En France, la liberté municipale a survécu à la féodalité. Lorsque déjà les seigneurs n'administraient plus les campagnes, les villes conservaient encore le droit de se gouverner. On en rencontre, jusque vers la fin du XVIIe siècle, qui continuent à former comme de petites républiques démocratiques, où les magistrats sont librement élus par tout le peuple et responsables envers lui, où la vie municipale est publique et active, où la cité se montre encore fière de ses droits et très jalouse de son indépendance.     Les élections ne furent abolies généralement pour la première fois qu'en 1692. Les fonctions municipales furent alors mises en offices, c'est-à-dire que le roi vendit, dans chaque ville, à quelques habitants, le droit de gouverner perpétuellement tous les autres.

Je ne donnerai qu'un exemple de ceci entre mille. Je trouve dans les rapports fait au ministre sur l'état de la librairie qu'au XVIe siècle et au commencement du XVIIe, il y avait des imprimeries considérables dans des villes de province qui n'ont plus d'imprimeurs ou dont les imprimeurs ne font plus rien. On ne saurait douter pourtant qu'il ne se publiât infiniment plus d'écrits de toute sorte à la fin du XVIIIe siècle qu'au XVIe mais le mouvement de la pensée ne partait plus que du centre. Paris avait achevé de dévorer les provinces.

Vous verrez sa signification s'étendre en Angleterre à mesure que les conditions se rapprochent et se mêlent. A chaque siècle on l'applique à des hommes placés un peu plus bas dans l'échelle sociale. Il passe enfin en Amérique avec les Anglais. Là on s'en sert pour désigner indistinctement tous les citoyens. Son histoire est celle même de la démocratie.

Dans le moyen âge et tant que la féodalité conserva son empire, tous ceux qui tenaient des terres du seigneur (ceux que la langue féodale nommait proprement des vassaux), et beaucoup d'entre eux n'étaient pas nobles, étaient constamment associés à celui-ci pour le gouvernement de la seigneurie ; c'était même la principale condition de leurs tenures. Non seulement ils devaient suivre le seigneur à la guerre, mais ils devaient, en vertu de leur concession, passer un certain temps de l'année à sa cour, c'est-à-dire l'aider à rendre la justice et à administrer les habitants.

Car, voyez ses effets : quand le bourgeois et le gentilhomme ne sont plus assujettis à payer la même taxe, chaque année l'assiette et la levée de l'impôt tracent à nouveau entre eux, d'un trait net et précis, la limite des classes. Tous les ans, chacun des privilégiés ressent un intérêt actuel et pressant à ne point se laisser confondre avec la masse, et fait un nouvel effort pour se ranger à l'écart.

Bien plus, qui eût pu sonder leur esprit eût découvert que ces petites barrières qui divisaient des gens si pareils leur paraissaient à eux-mêmes aussi contraires à l'intérêt publie qu'au bon sens, et qu'en théorie ils adoraient déjà l'unité.

Enfin ce fut ce désir d'empêcher que la nation, à laquelle on demandait son argent, ne redemandât sa liberté, qui fit veiller sans cesse à ce que les classes restassent à part les unes des autres, afin qu'elles ne pussent ni se rapprocher ni s'entendre dans une résistance commune, et que le gouvernement ne se trouvât jamais avoir affaire à la fois qu'à un très petit nombre d'hommes séparés de tous les autres.

    Les hommes du XVIIIe siècle ne connaissaient guère cette espèce de passion du bien-être qui est comme la mère de la servitude, passion molle, et pourtant tenace et inaltérable, qui se mêle volontiers et pour ainsi dire s'entrelace à plusieurs vertus privées, à l'amour de la famille, à la régularité des mœurs, au respect des croyances religieuses, et même à la pratique tiède et assidue du culte établi, qui permet l'honnêteté et défend l'héroïsme, et excelle à faire des hommes rangés et de lâches citoyens.

    On aurait donc bien tort de croire que l'ancien régime fut un temps de servilité et de dépendance. Il y régnait beaucoup plus de liberté que de nos jours ; mais c'était une espèce de liberté irrégulière et intermittente, toujours contractée dans la limite des classes, toujours liée à l'idée d'exception et de privilège, qui permettait presque autant de braver la loi que l'arbitraire, et n'allait presque jamais jusqu'à fournir à tous les citoyens les garanties les plus naturelles et les plus nécessaires. Ainsi réduite et déformée, la liberté était encore féconde.

La noblesse française s'obstine à demeurer à part des autres classes ; les gentilshommes finissent par se laisser exempter de la plupart des charges publiques qui pèsent sur elles ; ils se figurent qu'ils conserveront leur grandeur en se soustrayant à ces charges, et il paraît d'abord en être ainsi. Mais bientôt une maladie interne semble s'être attachée à leur condition, qui se réduit peu à peu sans que personne les touche, ils s'appauvrissent à mesure que leurs immunités s'accroissent. La bourgeoisie, avec laquelle ils avaient tant craint de se confondre, s'enrichit au contraire et s'éclaire à côté d'eux, sans eux et contre eux ; ils n'avaient pas voulu avoir les bourgeois comme associés ni comme concitoyens, ils vont trouver en eux des rivaux, bientôt des ennemis, et enfin des maîtres. Un pouvoir étranger les a déchargés du soin de conduire, de protéger, d'assister leurs vassaux ; mais comme en même temps il leur a laissé leurs droits pécuniaires et leurs privilèges honorifiques, ils estiment n'avoir rien perdu. Comme ils continuent à marcher les premiers, ils croient qu'ils conduisent encore, et, en effet, ils continuent à avoir autour d'eux des hommes que, dans les actes notariés, ils appellent leurs sujets ; d'autres se nomment leurs vassaux, leurs tenanciers, leurs fermiers. En réalité, personne ne les suit, ils sont seuls, et, quand on va se présenter enfin pour les accabler, il ne leur restera qu'à fuir.

Et il ne faut pas croire que ces êtres nouveaux aient été la création isolée et éphémère d'un moment, destinée à passer avec lui ; ils ont formé depuis une race qui s'est perpétuée et répandue dans toutes les parties civilisées de la terre,

La plupart commencent par se montrer fort ennemis des assemblées délibérantes, des pouvoirs locaux et secondaires, et, en général, de tous ces contre poids qui ont été établis, dans différents temps, chez tous les peuples libres, pour balancer la puissance centrale. « Le système des contre forces, dit Quesnay, dans un gouvernement est une idée funeste. - « Les spéculations d'après lesquelles on a imaginé le système des contre poids sont chimériques », dit un ami de Quesnay.

Ailleurs, aux États-Unis ou en Grande-Bretagne, il aurait été mis sur la touche. Mais, en France, au pays du capitalisme de connivence, il n’y a pas de véritable échec. Ainsi est la vie des affaires parisienne, toujours très accommodante pour les conflits d’intérêts : petits ou grands, les oligarques ne sont jamais sanctionnés.

C’est ce qu’il y a de fascinant dans le personnage : malgré tous ses échecs, malgré les graves déconvenues que tous ses clients ont connues, il reste un entremetteur apprécié du capitalisme parisien et rebondit sans cesse, après chaque échec.

Une explication possible est une montée soudaine du niveau de qualifications et de productivité de ces super-cadres, par comparaison à la masse des autres salariés. Une autre explication, qui me semble plus plausible, et dont nous verrons qu’elle est nettement plus cohérente avec les faits observés, est que ces cadres dirigeants sont dans une large mesure en capacité de fixer leur propre rémunération, parfois sans aucune retenue, et souvent sans relation claire avec leur productivité individuelle, au demeurant très difficile à estimer au sein d’organisations de grande taille.

Lorsque le taux de rendement du capital dépasse significativement le taux de croissance – et nous verrons que cela a presque toujours été le cas dans l’histoire, tout du moins jusqu’au XIXe siècle, et que cela a de grandes chances de redevenir la norme au XXIe siècle –, cela implique mécaniquement que les patrimoines issus du passé se recapitalisent plus vite que le rythme de progression de la production et des revenus. Il suffit donc aux héritiers d’épargner une part limitée des revenus de leur capital pour que ce dernier s’accroisse plus vite

11  Un seul et même Esprit opère toutes ces choses, les distribuant à chacun en particulier comme il veut. 12  Car, comme le corps est un et a plusieurs membres, et comme tous les membres du corps, malgré leur nombre, ne forment qu'un seul corps, ainsi en est-il de Christ. 13  Nous avons tous, en effet, été baptisés dans un seul Esprit, pour former un seul corps, soit Juifs, soit Grecs, soit esclaves, soit libres, et nous avons tous été abreuvés d'un seul Esprit. 14  Ainsi le corps n'est pas un seul membre, mais il est formé de plusieurs membres. 15  Si le pied disait: Parce que je ne suis pas une main, je ne suis pas du corps,  ne serait-il pas du corps pour cela? 16  Et si l'oreille disait: Parce que je ne suis pas un oeil, je ne suis pas du corps,  ne serait-elle pas du corps pour cela? 17  Si tout le corps était oeil, où serait l'ouïe? S'il était tout ouïe, où serait l'odorat? 18  Maintenant Dieu a placé chacun des membres dans le corps comme il a voulu. 19  Si tous étaient un seul membre, où serait le corps? 20  Maintenant donc il y a plusieurs membres, et un seul corps. 21  L'oeil ne peut pas dire à la main: Je n'ai pas besoin de toi; ni la tête dire aux pieds: Je n'ai pas besoin de vous. 22  Mais bien plutôt, les membres du corps qui paraissent être les plus faibles sont nécessaires; 23  et ceux que nous estimons être les moins honorables du corps, nous les entourons d'un plus grand honneur. Ainsi nos membres les moins honnêtes reçoivent le plus d'honneur, 24  tandis que ceux qui sont honnêtes n'en ont pas besoin. Dieu a disposé le corps de manière à donner plus d'honneur à ce qui en manquait, 25  afin qu'il n'y ait pas de division dans le corps, mais que les membres aient également soin les uns des autres. 26  Et si un membre souffre, tous les membres souffrent avec lui; si un membre est honoré, tous les membres se réjouissent avec lui. 27  Vous êtes le corps de Christ, et vous êtes ses membres, chacun pour sa part. 28  Et Dieu a établi dans l'Eglise premièrement des apôtres, secondement des prophètes, troisièmement des docteurs, ensuite ceux qui ont le don des miracles, puis ceux qui ont les dons de guérir, de secourir, de gouverner, de parler diverses langues. 29  Tous sont-ils apôtres? Tous sont-ils prophètes? Tous sont-ils docteurs? Tous ont-ils le don des miracles? 30  Tous ont-ils le don des guérisons? Tous parlent-ils en langues? Tous interprètent-ils? 31  Aspirez aux dons les meilleurs. Et je vais encore vous montrer une voie par excellence. 1

The first letter “M” refers to the arrival process, in this case a Markov process. In a Markov process, the elapsed time between arrivals is exponentially distributed. This simply means that short inter-arrival times are more probable than long ones. This is also known as a memoryless arrival pattern, because each arrival is statistically independent from the next.

Preemption gives us the fastest possible cycle time, but it is usually a bad practice because it creates inefficiencies that reduce the effective capacity of a bottleneck resource. Instead, it is usually sufficient to give head-of-the-line privileges. This will eliminate queue time, which is typically the largest component of cycle time.

Traditional economics assumes that prices of products in the market are determined by a balance between two forces: production at each price (supply) and the desires of those with purchasing power at each price (demand). The price at which these two forces meet determines the prices in the marketplace. This is an elegant idea, but it depends centrally on the assumption that the two forces are independent and that together they produce the market price.

If you accept the premise that market forces and free markets will not always regulate the market for the best, then you may find yourself among those who believe that the government (we hope a reasonable and thoughtful government) must play a larger role in regulating some market activities, even if this limits free enterprise. Yes, a free market based on supply, demand, and no friction would be the ideal if we were truly rational. Yet when we are not rational but irrational, policies should take this important factor into account.

reputation. IN TREATING THEIR EMPLOYEES—much as in treating their customers—companies must understand their implied long-term commitment. If employees promise to work harder to achieve an important deadline (even canceling family obligations for it), if they are asked to get on an airplane at a moment’s notice to attend a meeting, then they must get something similar in return—something like support when they are sick, or a chance to hold on to their jobs when the market threatens to take their jobs away. Although some companies have been successful in creating social norms with their workers, the current obsession with short-term profits, outsourcing, and draconian cost cutting threatens to undermine it all. In a social exchange, after all, people believe that if something goes awry the other party will be there for them, to protect and help them. These beliefs are not spelled out in a contract, but they are general obligations to provide care and help in times of need. Again, companies cannot have it both ways. In particular, I am worried that the recent cuts we see in employees’ benefits—child care, pensions, flextime, exercise rooms, the cafeteria, family picnics, etc.—are likely to come at the expense of the social exchange and thus affect workers’ productivity. I am particularly worried that cuts and changes in medical benefits are likely to transform much of the employer-employee social relationship to a market relationship.

Organic models can be contrasted with linear models on several dimensions: the way events are explained, the way a person is defined, the way a relationship is defined, and the attitude toward change. Let’s compare the two types of models on each of these in turn, then see how they affect the way leadership is defined.

Linear models get their name from the assumption of a linear relationship between events; that is, one effect stems from one cause, and vice versa. Organic models may be characterized by “systems thinking”: the belief that event X is the outcome of hundreds of other factors, including the passage of time.

Do It, Delegate It, or Defer It Once you’ve decided on the next action, you have three options: 1. Do it. If an action will take less than two minutes, it should be done at the moment it is defined. 2. Delegate it. If the action will take longer than two minutes, ask yourself, Am I the right person to do this? If the answer is no, delegate it to the appropriate entity. 3. Defer it, If the action will take longer than two minutes, and you are the right person to do it, you will have to defer acting on it until later and track it on one or more “Next Actions” lists.

The biggest issue for digitally oriented people is that the ease of capturing and storing has generated a write-only syndrome: all they’re doing is capturing information—not actually accessing and using it intelligently. Some consciousness needs to be applied to keep one’s potentially huge digital library functional, versus a black hole of data easily dumped in there with a couple of keystrokes. “I don’t need to organize my stuff, because the search feature can find it sufficiently” is, from what I’ve experienced, quite suboptimal as an approach. We need to have a way to overview our mass of collected information with some form of effective categorization.

The long feedback cycles associated with end-to-end tests aren’t just a problem when it comes to developer productivity. With a long test suite, any breaks take a while to fix, which reduces the amount of time that the end-to-end tests can be expected to be passing. If we deploy only software that has passed through all our tests successfully (which we should!), this means fewer of our services get through to the point of being deployable into production. This can lead to a pile-up. While a broken integration test stage is being fixed, more changes from upstream teams can pile

Instead of a single, geolocated team owning our catalog service, suppose that teams in the UK and India both are actively involved in changing a service — effectively having joint ownership of the service. Geographical and time zone boundaries here make fine-grained communication between those teams difficult. Instead, they rely on more coarse-grained communication via video conferencing and email. How easy is it for a team member in the UK to make a simple refactoring with confidence? The cost of communications in a geographically distributed team is higher, and therefore the cost of coordinating changes is higher.

Most Unicorns stick to their original vision (i.e., their founding MTP).

Few software managers are that misguided about the nature of operating systems, but many are when it comes to systems involving people. If the team isn’t productive enough, the manager decides, “Just replace the person who’s not providing the leadership. Then the team will work faster.” Sure it will.

If you ask a mechanic why your sports car’s engine sounds so awful, the response is likely to be, “Have you checked the spark plugs?” Experience says that if anything is failing, it’s most likely the plugs. It’s easy to slip from this observation into the fallacy that the spark plug is the critical component in an engine.

Because it can’t be cured, they had better learn to protect themselves through my four-step plan for early NPS detection: You describe your very difficult problem. The respondent says, “No problem!” You say, “Oh, that’s terrific! Could you please describe my problem that you’re going to solve?” 4a. If the respondent then describes your problem, even erroneously, it’s not a case of NPS but only a case of Enthusiasm. 4b. If the respondent describes a proposed solution to your problem rather than the problem itself, then sadly it’s NPS.

This myth persists because once in a while, someone does seem to acquire process skills without visible effort. Just as some people learn to program computers without direct training, others seem always to know just how to be most helpful.

Keep in mind that not every ranking need meet everyone’s complete approval in every detail, but that every team member should agree in principle with each ranking. • Avoid arguing for your own opinions, just because they are your own. Instead, back up every position you take with logic and facts. • Avoid changing your mind only to avoid conflict. Encourage others to give you facts and logic on which you can base a change of opinion. • Encourage others to use facts and logic before changing their minds. • Avoid techniques designed to reduce conflict, such as voting, averaging, or trading votes. Use facts, no matter how insignificant they may seem. • Consider differences of opinion as helpful, as long as they can be supported by fact or logic. • Don’t withhold information just to be nice. • If necessary, use your intuition, but make clear that you’re doing it.

The village idiot had just won the annual lottery, with a prize of two handsome horses and a fine carriage. One of the ne'er-do-wells of the village hitched a ride with him on his new carriage and asked, "How did you manage to pick the winning number, anyway? What's the secret of your success?"   The slow witted one, not seeing the barb in the query, replied, "Oh, it was easy. You see, my lucky number is seven, and the lottery was held on the seventh of the month, so I multiplied seven times seven and got sixty-three, the winning number."   "You idiot!" the loafer laughed, almost falling out of his seat.

Layers encapsulate some, but not all, things well. As a result you sometimes get cascading changes. The classic example of this in a layered enterprise application is adding a field that needs to display on the UI, must be in the database, and thus must be added to every layer in between.

This is the group that actually chooses the leader. In today’s China (as in the old Soviet Union), it consists of all voting members of the Communist Party; in Saudi Arabia’s monarchy it is the senior members of the royal family; in Great Britain, the voters backing members of parliament from the majority party. The most important of these groups is the third, the subset of the real selectorate that makes up a winning coalition. These are the people whose support is essential if a leader is to survive in office.

Fundamentally, the nominal selectorate is the pool of potential support for a leader; the real selectorate includes those whose support is truly influential; and the winning coalition extends only to those essential supporters without whom the leader would be finished. A simple way to think of these groups is: interchangeables, influentials, and essentials.

the term “dictatorship” really means a government based on a particularly small number of essentials drawn from a very large group of interchangeables and, usually, a relatively small batch of influentials. On the other hand, if we talk about democracy, we really mean a government founded on a very large number of essentials and a very large number of interchangeables, with the influential group being almost as big as the interchangeable group.

Unless they are fortunate enough to survive in office for a really long time, repaying today’s loan will be another leader’s problem.

The Supreme Court insists on the principle of one-person, one-vote and that is an excellent guideline. But it is a principle so easily distorted as to make congressional elections almost a farce except under extreme conditions. This is true for the simple reason that it is politicians in state legislatures who get to draw up congressional district boundaries. Shockingly enough, they design the boundaries to make it easier for their party to win.

Hosni Mubarak ran an oppressive, often violent regime against his fellow Egyptians, but he never ruled with the iron fist of a world-class oppressor like natural gas–rich Than Shwe or the vicious Cambodian murderer Pol Pot. Mubarak couldn’t afford to. With US aid waning, Mubarak needed tourist revenue more and more and so he showed a modicum of restraint.

Cooperation would lead to the best overall outcome in all of these cases, but Nash’s trap (which is now called a Nash equilibrium ) draws us by the logic of our own self-interest into a situation in which at least one of the parties fares worse but from which they can’t escape without faring worse still.

The game theorist’s way of describing a Nash equilibrium is that if each party has chosen a strategy, and no party can benefit by changing his or her strategy while the other parties keep theirs unchanged, then that set of strategy choices and the corresponding payoffs constitute a Nash equilibrium.

Before Nash published his paper, our frequent failure to cooperate with others for mutual benefit was usually thought of in terms of our psychology or our morality, or both. These are obviously important factors, but Nash demonstrated that a deep-seated problem in logic often lies at the heart of such problems, and that it can frequently be the dominant factor.

They began by considering the problem of how to divide a resource when one person claims ownership of all of it and another claims ownership of half of it. The answer? Divide it according to the ratio 75:25, because the ownership of half the resource by one of the parties is undisputed (and goes to that party), leaving the other half in dispute, for which the fairest solution is to divide the second half 50:50. They called their solution “equal division of the contested sum,” and proved that in the case of the man with three wives “the division of the estate among the three creditors is such that any two of them divide the sum they together receive, according to the principle of equal division of the contested sum.”

When there is some sort of hint that leaves all participants realizing that one Nash equilibrium is favored over others, that particular equilibrium is called a Schelling point. Its inventor, the Nobel Prize-winning economist Thomas Schelling, described it as a “focal point for each person’s expectation of what the other expects him to expect to be expected to do.”

The logic of self-interest that locks them in can, with Aumann’s unusual twist, help to undo the lock.

“In a poor organization, on the other hand, people spend much of their time fighting organizational boundaries, infighting, and broken processes. They are not even clear on what their jobs are, so there is no way to know if they are getting the job done or not. In the miracle case that they work ridiculous hours and get the job done, they have no idea what it means for the company or their careers. To make it all much worse and rub salt in the wound, when they finally work up the courage to tell management how fucked-up their situation is, management denies there is a problem, then defends the status quo, then ignores the problem.”
